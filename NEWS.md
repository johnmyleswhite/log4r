# log4r 0.4.2

* New `stderr_appender()` that writes to stderr (useful for RMarkdown docs).

* `json_log_layout()` gains `include_timestamp` argument which can be set
  to `FALSE` if whatever system collating your logs already adds a timestamp.
  
* `logger()` uses a more complex algorithm to determine the default `logger`.
  It uses `stderr_appender()` if you're running in knitr (so the result appears
  in the log, and not in your doc) and it uses `simple_layout()` if you're
  in a situation that's likely to automatically timestamps (i.e. running on
  CI platform or in Posit connect).

* Fixes a crash where `logfmt_log_layout()` would not correctly handle memory
  reallocation of the underlying buffer.

# log4r 0.4.1

* Fixes a crash when the `logfmt_log_layout()` is passed long fields that also
  need escaping.

* `logfmt_log_layout()` now drops fields with missing names rather than writing
  `NA`, which matches the existing handling of other empty/unrepresentable field
  names.

# log4r 0.4.0

* Support for structured logging by passing additional named parameters to the
  existing logging functions. This includes two new structured-logging layouts
  for JSON and [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) and a vignette on using
  them: "Structured Logging".

* New built-in appenders for writing to the Unix system log, via HTTP, and to
  TCP connections, plus a vignette on using them: "Logging Beyond Local Files".

* A new `bare_log_layout()` for when you don't want the level or timestamp
  handled automatically. This is most useful for the `syslog_appender()`.

* Log messages prior to the last entry are no longer lost when a file appender
  is created with `append = FALSE`. Instead, the file is truncated only when the
  appender is created, as intended. Fixes #17.

# log4r 0.3.2 (2020-01-17)

* Fixes an issue where appender functions did not evaluate all their arguments,
  leading to surprising behaviour in e.g. loops. Reported by Nicola Farina.

# log4r 0.3.1 (2019-09-04)

* There is now a vignette on logger performance.
* Fixes a missing header file on older versions of R (<= 3.4). (#12)
* Fixes an issue where `default_log_layout()` would not validate format strings
  correctly.

# log4r 0.3.0 (2019-06-20)

* A new system for configuring logging, via "Appenders" and "Layouts". See
  `?logger`, `?appenders`, and `?layouts` for details.
* Various fixes and performance improvements.
* New maintainer: Aaron Jacobs (atheriel@gmail.com)

# log4r 0.2 (2014-09-29)

* Same as v0.1-5.

# log4r 0.1-5 (2014-09-28)

* New maintainer: Kirill MÃ¼ller (krlmlr+r@mailbox.org)
* Log levels are now objects of class `"loglevel"`, access to the hidden
  constants, e.g., `log4r:::DEBUG`, is deprecated (#4).
